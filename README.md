# Semidefinite-and-Sum-Of-Squares-Optimization
This repository contains work completed as part of learning Semidefinite and Sum-of-Squares Optimization under the course ECE285: Semidefinite and Sum-of-Squares Optimization (Winter 2025), offered by Prof. Yang Zheng at UC San Diego (https://zhengy09.github.io/ECE285/ece285.html).

My main takeaways include implementing Sum-of-Squares (SOS) Optimization in Python from scratch, which significantly deepened my understanding of semidefinite programming (SDP), and symbolic polynomial manipulation (Sympy) and CVXPY.
